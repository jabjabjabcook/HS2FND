# HS2 Mod Finder

This is a tool for managing mods for Honey Select 2.

No installation is required; simply place the entire HS2FND folder into the Honey Select 2 installation folder and use it from there.

- The differences between this tool and kk manager are that it can display individual mod items by their in-game names and allows category search.
- You can register thumbnails for each mod item by dropping images onto them. (Mods that already have images inside their .zipmod files will display those images, but you can also add and register your own.)
- The tool can be used while the game is running.
- The first time you launch the tool, it may take some time to create the database. From the second time onwards, only updated mods will be scanned.
- Images you register yourself will be renamed and copied into the "thumbnail" folder, recreating the original mod's folder structure. As long as you use the same folder structure for your mods, you can reuse and share thumbnails with your friends.
- The tool is also compatible with AI Syoujyo to some extent.
